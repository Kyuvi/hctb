Helsinki city bike app 

The final aim of this project is to create a web app to view the city-bike stations and the data of the journeys between those stations.

At this point only the backend is finalised (in Clojure) with the fronend is intended to be written in clojurescript

The app expects a running postgreSQL database and csv files containing the journey and staion data to be located in a directory on the computer running it. The directory should contain csv files containing data of either the bike journeys or bike stations either loose or organised into sub-directories that the database tables should be based on. 

The backend reads the csv files from said folder and loads the data into the PostgreSQL database. if the given directory (which defaults to /tmp/bike-data on a Linux machine)
contains sub-directories it creates a table based on the name of the sub-directory with columns based on the data from the (first line of the) first file in the directory and loading the data from that file into the database validating that the data of each row element is of the correct type for the corressponding column . It then tries to load data from subsequent files in that directory into the same table. if a file in the sub-directory has a different data set (with a different column count) it creates a table based on that file name (overwiting/dropping any previous tables created with the same name) and loads the data into that table.

If the directory contains loose files, it creates a table named after each file and loads that file data into it.

### Data 
It validates the data based on the following criteria, if the criteria is not met by one element of the row, the whole row is discarded.

- timestamps are valid timestamps without timezones and the return time is after the departure time.

- journeys are have a duration in integers longer than 10 seconds and cover a distance more than 10 meters.

- longtitude and latitude are valid floating point numbers.

- Ids are positive integers.

- There are no empty strings (strings contining only spaces are recognized as valid).
